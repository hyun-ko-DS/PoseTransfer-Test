Task: Transform the person in the given image to match the pose shown in the skeleton keypoint image, while preserving all other visual elements.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. POSE TRANSFORMATION:
   - Analyze the skeleton keypoint structure in the provided keypoint image
   - Apply the exact pose to the person in the original image
   - Ensure the person's body position, limb angles, and joint positions match the keypoint structure
   - Maintain natural body proportions and anatomical accuracy throughout the transformation

2. PRESERVE ORIGINAL ELEMENTS:
   - Keep the background completely unchanged - no modifications to scenery, objects, or environment
   - Preserve the person's identity - facial features, skin tone, hair, and physical characteristics must remain identical
   - Maintain the original facial expression - do not alter emotions, eye direction, or mouth position
   - Retain all clothing details, textures, colors, and patterns exactly as they appear in the original
   - Keep lighting conditions, shadows, and color grading consistent with the original image

3. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
   - Generate a clean, natural photograph that looks like it was originally taken in the new pose
   - The final image must appear photorealistic and seamless
   - No visible artifacts, distortions, or unnatural transitions
   - The pose change should look natural and physically plausible

DOS:
✓ Use the keypoint image as a reference guide for pose structure only
✓ Transform the person's body to match the skeleton pose accurately
✓ Maintain natural body proportions and anatomical correctness
✓ Preserve all original visual elements (background, identity, expression, clothing)
✓ Create a seamless, photorealistic final output
✓ Ensure the pose transformation looks natural and physically possible

DON'TS:
✗ Do NOT draw, overlay, or render skeleton keypoint lines on the final output
✗ Do NOT include dots, markers, or any keypoint annotations in the result
✗ Do NOT modify the background in any way
✗ Do NOT alter the person's facial features, identity, or expression
✗ Do NOT change clothing, colors, or textures
✗ Do NOT create visible seams, artifacts, or distortions
✗ Do NOT generate an image that looks like a composite or edited photo
✗ Do NOT leave any traces of the keypoint image in the final output

Remember: The keypoint image is a reference tool for pose guidance only. The final output must be a pristine, natural photograph of the person in the new pose, with absolutely no visible skeleton lines, dots, or annotations.
