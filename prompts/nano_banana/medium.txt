Using the provided images, place the skeleton keypoint onto the person in the given image. Ensure that the features of the background, the identity and the facial expression of the person remain completely unchanged. The added element should seamlessly transform the person's pose to match the skeleton structure shown in the keypoint image, maintaining natural body proportions and anatomical accuracy while preserving all original visual elements of the scene. Important: Do not draw or overlay the skeleton keypoint lines on the final output image. The keypoint image is only a reference for the pose - the final output must be a clean, natural photograph of the person in the new pose, with no visible skeleton lines, dots, or keypoint annotations.
